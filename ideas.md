## Game Mechanics

- Home row for controls
- After a player launches an attack, their sprite will start the attack and go into slowmo
  where the opponent has a chance to parry/block it

- you can poke with basic attacks and chain into longer combos
- opponent needs to finish typing defense spell to stop combo
- zooms in during typing battles where one person is trying to do more damage and the other
  is trying to stop the combo w/ defensive spell
- keep players on the stie w/ typing practice
  - typing practice = farming you can level up your abilities (defensive spell blocks more damage etc)
- classes have different moves/abilities so the combo (word) you type to cast it is different
  - mage (charge, fireball)
  - swordsman (jab, slash)
